				<p>I produce full-stack JavaScript applications for the web and mobile devices. I do JavaScript on both the front-end and the back-end because it delivers a cohesive stack that other approaches cannot emulate.</p>
				<p>I cannot provide complex design work. I do work very well with designers, and I can implement designs as necessary.</p>
				<p>I am responsive to you during the week, and if you are local, you'll be able to contact me on my mobile phone as well.</p>
				<p>Everything I produce is yours immediately. I use code repositories so we can track progress together. In the unlikely event of my having to resign from your project, you can rest assured you will have ready access to everything that has been completed and in a state for another developer to pick up where I have left off.</p>
				<p>My weekly rate guarantees that your project is my only focus. You benefit by having my expertise and full attention on you and your needs. I will help you to prioritize your goals with a strong focus on your return on investment. I want us to share in the benefits of our coordinated efforts as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>All work is prepaid. This is for your benefit and mine. You'll never have to worry that your project isn't progressing, and my effort will never be subconsciously stymied by fear of a missed payment.</p>
				<p>I never commit to estimates. I know this isn't fun as a business owner trying to stay on top of budgeting concerns, but this policy does us both a favor. There are too many variables to analyze when estimating. It is better to allow your best ideas to come to light as I build your project. We are both more flexible, and you are better served in this way.</p>
